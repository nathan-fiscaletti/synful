[synful.io](http://synful.io/) - Simplified custom API's in minutes. 

### What is it?
Synful is a simple PHP framework that will allow you to create a customized API for any project you want. It allows for access to multiple databases at once, customized request handlers, and much more!

### Why do we call it Synful?
The idea behind this framework was to create something that goes against the grain as far as common API Standards go while still maintaining a secure, fast and reliable framework. The name came from a mixture of two things. Firstly, the idea of sinning, derivative of the latin 'sons' which translates to 'guilty' in regards to omitting current standards. And secondly one of the primary current standards, RESTful.

### How can I get it?
