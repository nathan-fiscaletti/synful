### What is Synful?
Synful is a simple PHP framework that will allow you to create a customized API for any project you want. It allows for access to multiple databases at once, customized request handlers, and much more!

### How can I get Synful?
To install synful you can use one of two options.
* Use Composer

     Using composer is the easiest way to set up an instance of Synful. See [Setting up Synful using Composer](https://github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/synful/wiki/Setting-up-Synful-using-composer) for more information.

* Clone the Git Repository

     To clone the repository simply create a new directory and run --

      `git clone https://github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/synful.git` 

     This will create a local working copy of the repository on your system which you can then use to set up your own instance of Synful. (See [Configuring your API](https://github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/synful/wiki/Configuring-your-API) for more info).
