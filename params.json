It allows for access to multiple databases at once, customized request handlers, and much more!\r\n\r\n### Why do we call it Synful?\r\nThe idea behind this framework was to create something that goes against the grain as far as common API Standards go while still maintaining a secure, fast and reliable framework. The name came from a mixture of two things. Firstly, the idea of sinning, derivative of the latin 'sons' which translates to 'guilty' in regards to omitting current standards. And secondly one of the primary current standards, RESTful.\r\n\r\n### How can I get it?\r\nHead over to [The Wiki Pages](http://github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/synful/wiki) for information on how to get Synful and what the next steps are to get your custom API Framework up and running!",
