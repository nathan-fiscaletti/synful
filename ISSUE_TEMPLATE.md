## Synful API Framework: Issue Report

### Synful Version

What version of Synful were you running when you experienced the issue? In versions v2.0.4 and higher, you can find this by typing 
`./synful -v` or `./synful -version`.

If neither of those commands are working due to errors, check in the `src/Synful/Synful.php` file under the `version()` function. If this function does not exist, you are running a version of the framework older than v2.0.4, in which case supply the commit ID if you have it available, or leave this blank.
